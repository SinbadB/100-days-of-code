# My Journey
### Day 0: April 26, 2020 

**Yesterday's Progress**: Decided to commit to #100daysofcodingchallenge and did research, planning and prep for today

**Thoughts**: Started off overwhelmed with the amount of infomation online, but focused on exactly what I wanted to achieve and stuck to it.

### Day 1: April 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:  I was able to learn the basics of GitHub, create my own repository and fork the #100daysofcodechallenge repo. I also researched, found and completed the first section of freecodecamp (The basics of html and html5).

**Thoughts**: Great start, it turns out I set the bar way too low. And once I got started time just disappeared

### Day 2: April 27, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:  Continued through the Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp. Completed Basic CSS and Applied Visual Design. I covered style elements such as font, color and borders as well as shadows. I also covered colour theory, fine text control, and animating.

**Thoughts**: Again time flew by as I worked my way through. I was surprised to see how familiar I was with the keyframe/animation properties, given my previous training in Flash from donkeys years ago. The more functions of CSS I understood the more project ideas I though of. I started a list so when I finally get to this stage, I should be all set.



### Day 3: April 28, 2020  (R1D3)

**Today's Progress**: Covered Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web design Principles. This included topics such as alt tags for images and clarity in structures for easily traversing the page and for screen readers.

**Thoughts**: Was a cold and rainy day sitting in the garden today on my laptop. Hot water bottles helped greatly. These accessibility options should be treated as the basics rather than the cherry on top. This is the sort of content that led me to do this sort of structured learning. I so rarely have need of these functions that it wouldn't have occurred to me to research this topic individually. I'll be having a play around with screen readers on a few sites to better understand this view of the web.


### Day 4: April 29, 2020  (R1D4)

**Today's Progress**: Covered CSS Flexbox and its constituent parts and uses.

**Thoughts**:  This is when my websites don't only look modern, they feel modern. I will have to find a cheat-sheets to catalogue these tags. While logical, there are increasingly subtle differences between terms. Cheat-sheets to help me for now, and practice to cement. I'm gonna leave CSS Grid until tomorrow and look into Flex a little more tonight. 


### Day 5: April 30, 2020  (R1D5)

**Today's Progress**: Covered CSS Grid.

**Thoughts**:  The grid. A digital frontier. I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer. What did they look like? Ships, motorcycles. With the circuits like freeways. I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see. And then one day, I got in.


### Day 6: May 01, 2020  (R1D6)

**Today's Progress**: I got myself up and running on CodePen, GitHub pages and Visual Studio Code.

**Thoughts**:  Fantastic day! I set myself the challenge of getting a website online by the end of the day. And I did it! I knew before I could publish anything I needed to find all of the basic tools necessary for the task. I found GitHub pages was perfect for what I needed. Free static published page that allows me to stay in (And continue to learn) the GitHub ecosystem. 

I also looked into CodePen, as it’s a part of the next section of freeCodeCamp and seems to be the online standard for sharing (Or at least displaying) code. 

Finally (so far today) I looked into Visual Studio Code. After looking over several code editors (Siblime, Atom and webstorm) I settled with Visual Studio Code as the current industry standard. I may find that alternatives offer something more suited to me later, but for now it fulfils all of my requirements and is most common on tutorials I have been watching.

### Day 7/8 May 02-03 2020  (R1D7-8)⠀
⠀
**Weekends Progress**: Continued tribute page research and development⠀
⠀
**Thoughts**:  Took it easy this weekend, did slightly more than hour each day actually coding (testing different layouts and colour combinations) but spent most of my time purchasing a new desk and finding a space for it in my home so I don't need to sit at the garden table anymore... ⠀
⠀
I listened to a few great podcasts while tidying from freeCodeCamp, and watched a few YouTube's of people building sites from scratch. It was great to see how even these experts had to do a quick Google here and there to get the task done.



### Day 9: May 09, 2020  (R1D8)

**Today's Progress**: In-depth practice of image manipulation and Grids in CSS.

**Thoughts**:  After a week long hiatus due to health and family I'm back. I've been using my "down" time to slowly change my online feeds (podcasts, YouTube, Reddit) to webdev sources. It's been great. But I missed coding! Today however was incredible! Our desk is now fully armed and operational (added second screen and I'm now longer working on garden table!). 

Great day working on my tribute page for freecodecamp responsive web design. I sketched exactly what I wanted it to look like, and after 8 hours of tweaking and only one complete restart I got it! I kept bouncing from tutorial to tutorial all with various ways of doing the same thing. Although I found a few solid resources/communities I'll be sticking around in as they were quite helpful. Will update with details when next on PC.
