# My Journey
### Day 0: April 26, 2020 

**Yesterday's Progress**: Decided to commit to #100daysofcodingchallenge and did research, planning and prep for today

**Thoughts**: Started off overwhelmed with the amount of infomation online, but focused on exactly what I wanted to achieve and stuck to it.

### Day 1: April 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:  I was able to learn the basics of GitHub, create my own repository and fork the #100daysofcodechallenge repo. I also researched, found and completed the first section of freecodecamp (The basics of html and html5).

**Thoughts**: Great start, it turns out I set the bar way too low. And once I got started time just disappeared

### Day 2: April 27, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:  Continued through the Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp. Completed Basic CSS and Applied Visual Design. I covered style elements such as font, color and borders as well as shadows. I also covered colour theory, fine text control, and animating.

**Thoughts**: Again time flew by as I worked my way through. I was surprised to see how familiar I was with the keyframe/animation properties, given my previous training in Flash from donkeys years ago. The more functions of CSS I understood the more project ideas I though of. I started a list so when I finally get to this stage, I should be all set.



### Day 3: April 28, 2020  (R1D3)

**Today's Progress**: Covered Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web design Principles. This included topics such as alt tags for images and clarity in structures for easily traversing the page and for screen readers.

**Thoughts**: Was a cold and rainy day sitting in the garden today on my laptop. Hot water bottles helped greatly. These accessibility options should be treated as the basics rather than the cherry on top. This is the sort of content that led me to do this sort of structured learning. I so rarely have need of these functions that it wouldn't have occurred to me to research this topic individually. I'll be having a play around with screen readers on a few sites to better understand this view of the web.


### Day 4: April 29, 2020  (R1D3)

**Today's Progress**: Covered CSS Flex and its constituent parts and uses.

**Thoughts**:  This is when my websites don't only look modern, they feel modern. I will have to find a cheat-sheets to catalogue these tags. While logical, there are increasingly subtle differences between terms. Cheat-sheets to help me for now, and practice to cement. I'm gonna leave CSS Grid until tomorrow and look into Flex a little more tonight.
