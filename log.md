# My Journey
### Day 0: April 26, 2020 

**Yesterday's Progress**: Decided to commit to #100daysofcodingchallenge and did research, planning and prep for today

**Thoughts**: Started off overwhelmed with the amount of infomation online, but focused on exactly what I wanted to achieve and stuck to it.

### Day 1: April 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:  I was able to learn the basics of GitHub, create my own repository and fork the #100daysofcodechallenge repo. I also researched, found and completed the first section of freecodecamp (The basics of html and html5).

**Thoughts**: Great start, it turns out I set the bar way too low. And once I got started time just disappeared

### Day 2: April 27, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Â Continued through the Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp. Completed Basic CSS and Applied Visual Design. I covered style elements such as font, color and borders as well as shadows. I also covered colour theory, fine text control, and animating.

**Thoughts**: Again time flew by as I worked my way through. I was surprised to see how familiar I was with the keyframe/animation properties, given my previous training in Flash from donkeys years ago. The more functions of CSS I understood the more project ideas I though of. I started a list so when I finally get to this stage, I should be all set.
